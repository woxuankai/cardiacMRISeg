  Cardiovascular disease poses a great threat to human health.
  Studies have shown that morphological structure of the left ventricle
  and cardiovascular disease
  (such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease, etc.)
  prediction and diagnosis are directly related.
  Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, with its unique advantages,
  is popular in the current clinical diagnosis of heart disease.
  The wildspread use of magnetic resonance imaging
  and the rapid development of imaging technology
  have resulted in massive amounts of data.
  At the same time,
  manual image segmentation brings great effort to clinicians.
  Therefore,
  the automatic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance images
  has become one of the hot spots.
  As the heart movement is non-rigid,
  the morphological differences in different periods of are huge,
  and the contrast between the heart tissue is low,
  the heart of the automatic segmentation has always been difficult.
  Due to the existence of non-rigid deformation,
  Multi-atlas method has made great success in the brain image segmentation.
  In this paper, according to the characteristics of the cardiac image,
  we made slightly change to the multi atlas method,
  and successfully use it to complete the left ventricular segmentation.
