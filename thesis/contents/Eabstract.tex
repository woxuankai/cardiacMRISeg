  Cardiovascular disease poses a great threat to human health.
  Studies have shown that morphological structure of the left ventricle
  and cardiovascular disease
  (such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease, etc.)
  prediction and diagnosis are directly related.
  Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging,  with its unique advantages,
  is polular in the current clinical diagnosis of heart disease.
  The improvement of magnetic resonance imaging speed and quality
  not only bring a lot of data,
  but also has brought huge and boring workload to artificial labeling.
  In summary, 
  the automatic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance images
  has become a hotspot.
  Due to the existence of non-rigid deformation,
  large morphological differences,
  low tissue contrast,
  poor imaging results,
  the heart is difficult to automatically segment.
  Multi-atlas method has made great success in the brain image segmentation.
  In this paper, according to the characteristics of the cardiac image,
  we made slightly change to the multi atlas method,
  and successfully use it to complete the left ventricular segmentation.
