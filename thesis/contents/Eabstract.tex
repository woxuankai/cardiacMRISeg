Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the biggest cause of deaths worldwide.
More than 17 million people died from CVDs in 2008.
More than 3 million of these deaths occurred before the
age of 60 and could have largely been prevented.
The percentage of premature deaths from CVDs ranges from 4\% in high-income
countries to 42\% in low-income countries, leading to growing
inequalities in the occurrence and outcome of CVDs between
countries and populations.

There are also new dimensions to this alarming situation. Over
the past two decades, deaths from CVDs have been declining in
high-income countries, but have increased at an astonishingly
fast rate in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).
